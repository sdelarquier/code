		THE MERGE PROGRAM
		-----------------

- You will find a complete documentation on the MERGE program in the
  postcript files 'merge.ps' and 'figxx.ps' contained in the DOC directory.

- The fortran for the MERGE program is in merge.f, and all the routines
  developped specifically for this program are in the directory 'routines'.

- The program also needs many of the routines developped at APL that can
  be found in the directory 'gen', 'mag', 'pgm', and 'fit'. It also needs
  all the include files found in the directory 'include'.

- To build the executable program:
  (i)   Put the file info.inc into the 'include' directory;
  (ii)  Declare your environment variables:
	LPATH (for your librairies' path),
	SD_FITROPEN_PATH (for the directory where the data can be found),
	SD_HARDWARE (for the 'hardware.dat' file used by RADAR_POS);
  (iii) Change the directory names in the open statements of the routines
	/mag/igrfcall.f and /pgm/cnvcoord.f
  (iv)  Build the shared librairies using the 'make_libs' file. This
	makefile is a little different from the one that can be found
	in the 'lib' directory.
  (v)   Build the executable program using the 'make_merge' file
