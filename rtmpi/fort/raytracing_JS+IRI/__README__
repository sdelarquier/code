This is an unofficial release of the Jones & Stephenson ray tracing code coupled with IRI-2007.

The current version has not been tested in over a year, and has undergone multiple edits from multiple 
contributors (for better or for worse). Use with extreme caution.

To compile the code, use the provided Makefile by typing:
	> make clean
	> make

As a default, the makefile uses gfortran, but you can edit the FC variable inside Makefile for your prefered 
Fortran compiler (keeping in mind that this code has only ever been tested with gfortran, and that compilers 
are not all the same).

The code produces various output files, some ascii, some binary, which are all placed in the 'out' directory.
The simplest file to look at is 'outfile.dat' which simply provides information on each caluclated ray.

As most of the people who have once played with the J&S ray tracing code, you will get severly annoyed with
the fortran 77 syntax, strange conventions, and global variables. When this time comes, you will do what we
all have done, write your own ray tracing code!

Good luck!
