This package contains everthing needed to run the fully analytic 3D 
(local) and 4D (Millstone Hill regional and America Regional) models.

"Fully analytic" means that variations in season (day number), local time, 
height and latitude are expressed in mathmatical functions, namely, 
harmonic functions for seasonal and local time variations, cublic B-spline 
function for the height variation, and cublic polynomial for latitudinal 
variations.

WHAT FILES ARE NEEDED 

basis.f        basis3.h       isrim.f  
basis.h        basis4.h       make3D4D*      testISRIM.f
basis1.h       coefiles/      tb3D4D.f

isrim.f:  the model interface, the model subroutine that users can use.
tb3D4D.f: the command-line controled model program. It reads inputs 
          from the command line, then call isrim.f to run the model.
make3D4D: executable scripts to compile and link files for tb3D4D.f
testISRIM.f:  a very simple test main program;

coefiles/ contains coefficient files

how to run   -

1- compile and link the programs; run ths shell script: make3D4D
2- run the main program tb3D4D

NOTES:

isrim.f is the latest and official version of the incoherent scatter radar 
ionospheric models (ISRIMs); this version reads in all coefficients for a 
given site/kinst; when site is changed it will read coefficients again. 
So different from isrim0.f (see below), it is efficient when it is called 
with frequently switching parameter. This version takes more memory.

isrim0.f is also a useful version which has the same interface and
functions but this version works mostly efficiently when it is called for
a given site and a specific parameter, and it takes less memory.  
However, when it is called with frequently switching site and parameter,
it has to keep reading coefficients in responding to the changing site and
parameter.

glat, geodetic latitude, is an output when a local model is called giving
the site's latitude; so when subroutine isrim is called with changes
between local and regional models (in kinst), be sure glat is reset to the
correct one when the regional model is computed.
